    What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? Between an
   unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

    (a)

    short, int, long, long long have differenct sizes:

    short: at least 16bits;

    int: at least as large as short;

    long: at least 32bits, and at least as large as int;

    long long: at least 64bits, and at least as large as long, introduced by new
   standard.

    (b)

    A signed type represents negative or positive numbers(including zero);

    An unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to zero.

    (c)

    float: single-precision floating-point value, at least yields 6 significant
   digits;

    double: double-precision floating-point value, at least yields 10
   significant digits.
