// tuple is more flexible; you can use pair to achieve the same goal, but you
// will need to write obj.first.second...and so on, and that seems shitty;

// But I will prefer not to use tuple or pair instead, because tuple/pair's
// member can be accessed directly, and in most cases this is weird, members
// should be accessed via an interface
