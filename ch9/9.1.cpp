// Which is the most appropriate—a vector,a deque,or a list—for the following
// program tasks? Explain the rationale for your choice. If there is no reason
// to prefer one or another container, explain why not.

// (a) Read a fixed number of words, inserting them in the container
// alphabetically as they are entered. We’ll see in the next chapter that
// associative containers are better suited to this problem.
// (A) list, or set(chapter11)

// (b) Read an unknown number of words. Always insert new words at the back.
// Remove the next value from the front.
// (A) deque

// (c) Read an unknown number of integers from a file. Sort the numbers and then
// print them to standard output.
// (A) vector, use STL sort to sort elements
